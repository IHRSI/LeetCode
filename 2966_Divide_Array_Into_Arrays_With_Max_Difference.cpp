Avoids extra temporaries
Uses brace-init, enabling better compiler optimization
Reduces memory allocation overhead

/*
Why This Is Greedy:
You sort the array first â€” this ensures that closest numbers are grouped together.
Then you greedily pick every group of 3 consecutive numbers (after sorting) and check if the difference between the largest and smallest is within k.
You don't backtrack, nor do you try all combinations. You simply take the smallest unused elements and form the next valid group as early as possible.
ðŸ§  Greedy Choice Property
You assume:
"If I pick the next 3 closest numbers (after sorting), and they satisfy the condition, this choice is safe and optimal."
And thatâ€™s the core of greedy â€” locally optimal â†’ globally correct.
